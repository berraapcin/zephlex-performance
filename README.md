# Full Stack App – React + Node.js + Firebase 🔥

This project is a **learning-based full stack application** developed using **React**, **Node.js**, **Vite**, **Firebase Authentication**, and **MySQL**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a personal learning experience to improve my skills in full stack web development. I aimed to practice frontend/backend integration, routing, authentication, API calls, and working with databases.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- React (with TypeScript)
- Vite
- Ant Design for UI components
- React Router for routing
- Firebase Authentication for login/register
- Firestore & Firebase Storage

### Backend:
